Title of the Project
Eatables

Abstract
Eatables allows users to discover new food options and read reviews
based on their location. Users can search for restaurants and other food
establishments in their area, view information about each one, and read
reviews from other users. They can also leave their own reviews and ratings.
The app uses location data to provide relevant results and
recommendations. Additionally, users can create a list of must-try items.
The app can be used on desktop and mobile devices. This food discovery
platform not only helps users find new food options and read reviews.

Objective of the Project

Providing a platform for users to share their own experiences and opinions
about the hotels they’ve visited.
